# 🌐 The Interaction Lifecycle

In the previous section, we discussed the lifecycle of a single interaction between a **Client** (💻) and a **Server** (🌐). Now, let’s examine the full lifecycle of a complete interaction under the **MCP protocol**.

The MCP protocol defines a structured sequence of stages:

## 🔹 Initialization

1. The **Client** connects to the **Server**.
2. They exchange protocol versions and capabilities.
3. The **Server** responds with its supported protocol version and capabilities.

```
💻 → initialize → 🌐  
💻 ← response   ← 🌐  
💻 → initialized → 🌐  
```

* The **Client** confirms that initialization is complete via a notification message.

## 📝 Message Types

MCP has these main types of messages:

### Requests

Requests expect a response from the other side:

```typescript
interface Request {
  method: string;
  params?: { ... };
}
```

### Results

Results are successful responses to requests:

```typescript
interface Result {
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

### Errors

Errors indicate that a request failed:

```typescript
interface Error {
  code: number;
  message: string;
  data?: unknown;
}
```

### Notifications

Notifications are one-way messages that don't expect a response:

```typescript
interface Notification {
  method: string;
  params?: { ... };
}
```

## 🔹 Discovery

1. The **Client** requests a list of available capabilities.
2. The **Server** responds with the available tools.

```
💻 → tools/list → 🌐  
💻 ← response    ← 🌐  
```

* This process may be repeated for each tool, resource, or prompt type.

## 🔹 Execution

1. The **Client** invokes a capability based on its current needs.
2. The **Server** may send an optional progress notification.
3. The **Server** returns a response.

```
💻 → tools/call → 🌐  
💻 ← notification (optional progress) ← 🌐  
💻 ← response                       ← 🌐  
```

## 🔹 Termination

1. The **Client** gracefully shuts down the connection.
2. The **Server** acknowledges the shutdown.
3. The **Client** sends a final exit message.

```
💻 → shutdown → 🌐  
💻 ← response ← 🌐  
💻 → exit     → 🌐  
```

* The interaction lifecycle concludes with the **Client**'s `exit` message.

## 📋 Best Practices

### Transport Selection

#### Local Communication
- Use stdio transport for local processes
- Efficient for same-machine communication
- Simple process management

#### Remote Communication
- Use Streamable HTTP for scenarios requiring HTTP compatibility
- Consider security implications including authentication and authorization

### Message Handling

#### Request Processing
- Validate inputs thoroughly
- Use type-safe schemas
- Handle errors gracefully
- Implement timeouts

#### Progress Reporting
- Use progress tokens for long operations
- Report progress incrementally
- Include total progress when known

#### Error Management
- Use appropriate error codes
- Include helpful error messages
- Clean up resources on errors

### Security Considerations

#### Transport Security
- Use TLS for remote connections
- Validate connection origins
- Implement authentication when needed

#### Message Validation
- Validate all incoming messages
- Sanitize inputs
- Check message size limits
- Verify JSON-RPC format

#### Resource Protection
- Implement access controls
- Validate resource paths
- Monitor resource usage
- Rate limit requests

#### Error Handling
- Don't leak sensitive information
- Log security-relevant errors
- Implement proper cleanup
- Handle DoS scenarios

### Debugging and Monitoring

#### Logging
- Log protocol events
- Track message flow
- Monitor performance
- Record errors

#### Diagnostics
- Implement health checks
- Monitor connection state
- Track resource usage
- Profile performance

#### Testing
- Test different transports
- Verify error handling
- Check edge cases
- Load test servers

# How Capabilities Work Together

Let’s look at how these capabilities work together to enable complex interactions. In the table below, we’ve outlined the capabilities, who controls them, the direction of control, and some other details.

| **Capability** | **Controlled By** | **Direction**            | **Side Effects**  | **Approval Needed**   | **Typical Use Cases**                   |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Tools          | Model (LLM)       | Client → Server          | Yes (potentially) | Yes                   | Actions, API calls, data manipulation   |
| Resources      | Application       | Client → Server          | No (read-only)    | Typically no          | Data retrieval, context gathering       |
| Prompts        | User              | Server → Client          | No                | No (selected by user) | Guided workflows, specialized templates |
| Sampling       | Server            | Server → Client → Server | Indirectly        | Yes                   | Multi-step tasks, agentic behaviors     |

These capabilities are designed to work together in complementary ways:

* A user might select a **Prompt** to start a specialized workflow.
* The **Prompt** might include context from **Resources**.
* During processing, the AI model might call **Tools** to perform specific actions.
* For complex operations, the **Server** might use **Sampling** to request additional LLM processing.

The distinction between these primitives provides a clear structure for MCP interactions, enabling AI models to access information, perform actions, and engage in complex workflows while maintaining appropriate control boundaries.

# MCP SDK Overview

Both SDKs provide similar core functionality, following the MCP protocol specification we discussed earlier. They handle:

* Protocol-level communication
* Capability registration and discovery
* Message serialization/deserialization
* Connection management
* Error handling
